      Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you
      didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail
      away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore.
      Dream. Discover.

      Love is the ultimate outlaw. It just won't adhere to any rules. The most
      any of us can do is to sign on as its accomplice. Instead of vowing to
      honor and obey, maybe we should swear to aid and abet. That would mean
      that security is out of the question. The words "make" and "stay" become
      inappropriate. My love for you has no strings attached. I love you for
      free.
